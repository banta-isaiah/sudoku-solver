# Project Proposal

For my final project I will create a Sudoku Solver. 

## Brief Description of Sudoku

Sudoku is a number puzzle. Taken from Wikipedia:

> The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes, "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. 

## Type of Problem
Sudoku is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem as the numbers in a column, box, or row, limit the integers that are allowable in the same box/row/column.

## Possible Problems
Some Sudoku puzzles are much harder than others. 
I will be curious to see what the run-time complexity will be for varying difficulties of Sudoku puzzles.

I will also have to decide how to handle puzzles with more than one solution, or no solution. 

## Above and Beyond . . . 

It would be very cool to judge the difficulty of a puzzle based on how long or how many comparisons my program makes.
I would also like to implement the creation of puzzles, however this may be much more difficult and I will do this if I have time.

## Frameworks

 - I plan to use Python and not implement a GUI. 
 - The code and this README.md will be posted on a Github repository on my profile.
