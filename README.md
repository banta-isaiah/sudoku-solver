# A.I. Final Project - Spring 2018

### Installing dependencies
I have a _requirements.txt_ file that you can run using pip to make sure you have all needed dependencies. (I think there is only one though..)
I tried doing this with `pip freeze` but realized that saved ALL dependencies located on my machine instead of the ones only being used for my project.
So I installed [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs) which is a cool tool that allows you to specify the path to your project.

### Running the program

By default, my program is solving sudoku puzzles provided by a variety of textfiles.

Sudoku puzzles are represented in the form:

```
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
000000000
```

For now, I only have a textfile contain 1 sudoku puzzle.
